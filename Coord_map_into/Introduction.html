<p>

    For the next few games, you will play the following scenario:
</p>
<p>
    You have been inserted behind enemy lines in unfamiliar terrain. Your team (the other students) are scattered across the landscape and you are all many miles from your pre-planned rendezvous location. To make matters worse communications are down due to electronic interferrence. However, you do have a paper map of the area and so do the rest of your teammates. Your job is to meet up with as much of your team as possible.
</p>
<p>    
Over the next few pages each student will see the same map. Your should choose the coordinates (grid square) for where you will try to meet up with your classmates. You will recieve one point for every other classmate that chooses the same grid square.
</p>
<p>   
Sometimes your communications may come back online and you will be given the opportunity to chat with the other players in the scenario before making a choice.
